      <h3>Main Role: 2D Artist and Designer</h3>
      <p>Don't Spend Time On It is an award winning game in Hero Jam 2017, a 48 hour Game Jam competition for charity. I provide 2D pixel styled art assets and animations.<br><br>
        
        Things I learned from this Project: <br>
            - 2D pixel animation <br>
            - How to design and developm a game in a short amount of time<br>
            - The importance of understanding a time frame and scope<br><br>

      <h4>Quintessence</h4>
      <h3>Main Role: UI Designer and 2D Artist</h3>
      <p>Quintessence is an RPG with Card Game-based mechanics for interaction between characters. Quintessence was designed to create interesting npcs and dynamic interactions with those npcs relatively quickly. I've worked on this project as a UI/UX Designer and as a 2D Art Asset producer for two semesters.<br><br>
        
        Things I learned from this Project: <br>
            - How to work on a larger team with specified rolls and leads to report to <br>
            - How to design and implement a changing UI layout(See UI Design and Mockups Below)<br>
            - Game Design for Collectible Card Games, more specifically worked on mechanics for a card game meant to represent both human interaction and personality where each round was a conversation that replaced simply choosing a response like in most RPGs<br><br>

    <h4>RolePlay CG, Project: Quintessence</h4>
    <p>A major part of Quintessence is our card-game based system for creating characters and being able to create interesting role-playing scenarios using these cards by playing actions to trigger the other player's traits and change their three resoures: Morale, Appeal, and Safety. Forcing your opponent's resources to certain values change their mood and thus how they will interact with you for the rest of the game. Shown here is one of the field layouts for a very early build of the game that I designed.<br><br>
      
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k1vRzQmfP7IzV40NxlE-qH4RhXp5eQvdK_Od23zruyg/edit?usp=sharing"> Design Document for Quintessence CG can be found here</a><br>
      *Created in Cooperation with Joel Tom, he did the writing, I did the mockups/pictures*
      
      <br><br>
      
    This design was based off of Yugioh's Duel Network, a card game system where the mechanics are present but aren't done automatically. We replicated the system to prototype mechanics on a digital platform.

    <h4>Final UI Design</h4>
    <p>This is the final layout for the Quintessence Card Game. The idea came about from wanting to have an ingame UI, and most of the story revolved around this book that held all of the information the player had collected, so we wanted the book to be an active UI element. Although we ran into problems of knowing whose cards were whose, I believe this was a good choice visually and could be learned.<br><br>

    <h4>Types of Cards, Project: Quintessence</h4>
    <p>In Quintessence, there are Archtypes, Roles, traits, and a few different types of Action Cards that are categorized as General, Role-based, Location-based. Depending on the Location of an interaction, additional Action cards will be added to both players' decks. Other Action Cards are both the General Cards anyone can use, and Role-based cards that can only be used by specific roles. Everyone's traits and roles begin facedown, and part of the game is to determine the other opponent's traits and roles and play accordingly.<br> <br>
      
      Archetype Cards:<br>
          - Acted as the players defining card, what their goal was in the overall narrative, also acted as their "ultimate ability" in game, Was not fully implemented.<br><br>
      
      Role Cards:<br>
          - Defined what the player or character was in Society, could have up to two Role Cards.<br>
          - Changed the Player's base resources at the beginning of the game based on the opponent's Role since Roles had different levels of Security, Morality, and Appeal to different Roles. This information is shown on the card.<br><br>
      
      Traits:<br>
          - Started face down, and when certain conditions, or "Triggers", are met, are flipped face up and activate an effect.<br>
          - Helped flesh out a character in the narrative through gameplay.<br><br>
      
      Action Cards:<br>
          - Cards that made up the actual deck, since Archetype, Role, and Traits cards appear on the field at the beginning of the game.<br>
          - Many action cards have requirments, such as having a certain amount of resources, to be playable.
          - Action Cards normally changed either player's resources, but Utility Action Cards allowed you to search your own deck for specific cards or make other cards easier to play.<br>

    <div class="UIdescriptions"style="width 80%">
    <h4>The Stash pt 1, Project: Quintessence</h4>
    <p>One of the most unique mechanics in our game is the Stash. The Stash is a location where players are able store and access cards separate from their hand. The Stash allows the player to reserve up to three cards before an interaction that they think will be important to have later in a interaction and acts as a way to keep the player from hitting any roadblocks that slow gameplay. They are meant to represent a players prepared motivations for a coming encounter.<br> <br>

    <h4>The Stash part 2, Project: Quintessence</h4> 
    <p>Players can also add cards to the Stash during their Action Phase, where instead of playing an Action Card, they can put as many cards from their hand into their stash and then draw as many cards as they stashed, or whenever they need to discard cards due to hand limit, they can add to the Stash instead. Players may only have up to 5 cards in their stash at any given time.<br><br>

    <h4>Halo 5 Map: Ups and Downs</h4> 
    <p>These are concept drawings for a Halo 5 map that I made using the Forge on Xbox One. It is meant for a 4v4 Slayer game type mode. Essentially I wanted to make a map that focused on verticallity and teams splitting up to get as many of the power weapons and buffs as possible. You can find a more in-depth analysis of the map with commentary by me here as I go several iterations:<br>

    <h4>Mirror Mirror' Evolution</h4> 
    <p>Mirror Mirror originally began as a left to right endless runner. When we playtested, players weren't very satisfied with it, but they did however enjoy the Wall Jumping mechanic, so we changed up our design a bit. Instead of running Horizontally bashing through everything, Mirror Mirror became a Vertical avoid falling obstacle type of game, which can be shown through the difference of the Level Sketches. Also We planned to have a "Spider Boss" who would interrupt your climb, but we were never able to implement it due to time.<br><br>
